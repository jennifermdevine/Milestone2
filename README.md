# Are you dining In or Out?

This project was created together by Elva Plazola, Jennifer Devine, Mathew Puig, and Zoren Gabriel Villareal for UNLV/ThriveDX's software development bootcamp.

### The Problem

Today’s accessibility to delivery services creates an overwhelming
amount of choices for day-to-day users. Typically we disregard
some of our favorite home-cooked meals when they’re not
displayed in front of us like the restaurants we order from every
day

### The Solution

Having one website to collect recipes, local restaurants, and
photos of your favorite dishes allows the user to create a
customizable menu that makes deciding what to eat a little bit
easier.

### Tech Used

React, React Router, Express, Sequelize, Node, Supabase, and Render.
